Description: eBPF UDP -> TCP obfuscator
 Mimic is an experimental UDP to TCP obfuscator designed to bypass UDP
 QoS and port blocking. Based on eBPF, it directly mangles data inside
 Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the kernel space and restores data
 using XDP, achieving remarkably high performance compared to other
 projects, such as udp2raw or Phantun.
 .
 This package contains the Mimic CLI and eBPF packet handler.

Description: eBPF UDP -> TCP obfuscator (DKMS kernel module)
 Mimic is an experimental UDP to TCP obfuscator designed to bypass UDP
 QoS and port blocking. Based on eBPF, it directly mangles data inside
 Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the kernel space and restores data
 using XDP, achieving remarkably high performance compared to other
 projects, such as udp2raw or Phantun.
 .
 This package uses DKMS to automatically build kernel module against
 current kernel.
 .
 Mimic works out-of-the-box with Debian kernel shipped in trixie (and
 versions above) without mimic-dkms' Recommends. Older or third-party
 kernels are supported with best effort and with Recommends, but your
 milage may vary. Linux version less than (exclusive) 6.1 and s390x
 with non-official kernels are not supported at all.
